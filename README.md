# Readme for "Unilateral Facilitation Does Not Increase Migration" 

 Emily A. Beam, David McKenzie, Dean Yang

 Last updated: June 05, 2018

## Instructions 

 1.  Unzip any zipped data files in the `Data` filder 
1.  Set `$path` to working directory of your analysis in `0_0_MasterAnalysis_2017.do`: Master do-file 
1. Run do-files, making sure that you run `swap_specification.do` and `swapspec` commands before any analysis files. 


  - `swapspec` has 5 arguments: `swapspec [dataset] [sample restrictions] [treatment sets] [report p-values]`
    - dataset: list dataset (`attritfull.dta`)
    - sample restrictions: `baselineno4145` excludes the 41-45 age group, `baseline` includes all ages
    - treatment sets: `ascending15` is the main option
    - report p-values: `nopval` for no p-values, or `pval`

##Data files: 
 | File | Purpose|
 | ---| --- |
| `merged_data_public.dta`| Public-use data file |
|`roster2013_fup`| Roster for 2013 follow-up |
|`FUP2013.dta`| 2013 follow-up data|
| `attritiondata.dta`| Data for attrition tables|

## Errata: 

* Appendix Table 3: 
	* Error in statistics significance stars: 
		* Column 2: HS Graduate and some college or vocational should not have stars
		* Column 3: HS graduate and some college or vocational should have 1 star 
* Appendix Table 2: Coefficient discrepancies in column 1 at the thousandths place 
* Appendix Table 9: The coefficients in the last two rows are not correct. 
  *  `A9_AltMigration.do` has been revised to drop the variable `aa_assign` at the beginning of the code. As a result, it will not perfectly replicate Appendix Table A9

##  Note on translating treatment variables

### Notes 

 - There were minor edits to the endline survey made as a result of field testing (v2.7). However, that version is exclusively in Bikol. It is available from the authors upon request

## Relevant Files

### Original file names
* Baseline survey: `100519_BaselineSurvey_4.0.doc`
* Benchmark survey: `Benchmark Survey Final Bikol.doc`
* Endline survey: `Final Survey Draft v2.5_May18.docx`
	- Codebook: `Final_Survey_Codebook_2.6_May22.xlsx`
* 2013 follow-up `FinalSurvey_Migrant Follow-Upv0.2.doc`
	- This survey was only conducted with a subset of respondents who reported current or pending overseas job offers at endline.



  

## General notes

* Prior to creating the main data analysis files, there were a mess of files containing PII. The container for these is in `~/Dropbox/FacilitatingMigration_June2018/PII_encrypted`. Within there are some do-files, which generate `merged_data_public`, among other files.

## Notes: 

 - There was a difference between the aa_ and the bb_ set of treatment variables. That is because the aa_ set of variables was inadvertently including aa1-a14, plus the continuous variable `aa_assign`. Should have used `aa1_-aa14_` rather than `aa*`
